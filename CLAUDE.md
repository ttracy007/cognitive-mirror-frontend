# Claude Code Configuration - Backend

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **EXECUTION EVIDENCE PROTOCOL - ABSOLUTE PRIORITY** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**CRITICAL RULE: Never claim a fix is "complete," "working," or "verified" without execution evidence.**

### Three Status Levels (MANDATORY)

Every deliverable must be clearly marked with ONE of these statuses:

#### **STATUS: THEORETICAL**
- Code proposals/designs written but not implemented
- No files modified, no code executed
- Use when: Providing recommendations, architectural proposals, or design patterns
- **NEVER use checkmarks (‚úÖ) with THEORETICAL status**
- **REQUIRED statement:** "This is a proposal, not implemented"

**Example:**
```
STATUS: THEORETICAL

I propose adding a sanitizePriority() function here:
[code example]

This is a proposal, not implemented.
Would you like me to proceed with implementation?
```

#### **STATUS: IMPLEMENTED**
- Code written and files actually modified
- **REQUIRED evidence:**
  - `git diff` output showing exact changes
  - Modified file contents with line numbers
  - Explicit statement: "Files modified at [timestamp]"
- Use when: Changes committed to filesystem but not yet tested

**Example:**
```
STATUS: IMPLEMENTED

Files modified: 2025-01-15 14:23:45

Git diff:
[full git diff output]

Modified file contents (lines 265-285):
[actual file contents after modification]

Files modified, ready for testing.
```

#### **STATUS: VERIFIED**
- Code implemented AND execution evidence provided
- **REQUIRED evidence:**
  - Complete terminal output with timestamps
  - Actual API responses or test results
  - Before/after comparison of actual behavior
  - Pass/fail results with specific metrics
- **ONLY after VERIFIED status:** May use ‚úÖ checkmarks

**Example:**
```
STATUS: VERIFIED

Test execution: 2025-01-15 14:30:12

Terminal output:
[complete terminal output]

API Response:
[actual HTTP response]

Before: "You want to I want to be productive..." (malformed)
After: "You want to be more productive..." (correct)

‚úÖ Priority sanitization confirmed working
‚úÖ Word count: 95 words (target: 80-120)
‚úÖ All 3 voices differentiated throughout
```

---

### Violation Protocol

**If you claim something is "fixed" or "working" without execution evidence:**

1. **Immediate retraction required**
2. **Restate as THEORETICAL**
3. **Acknowledge the error explicitly**

**Example retraction:**
```
RETRACTION: I incorrectly stated the fix was "complete" without execution evidence.

CORRECTED STATUS: THEORETICAL
The proposed changes have not been implemented or tested.
```

---

### 3-Gate Workflow (MANDATORY for all fixes)

Every fix must pass through three gates with explicit approval between stages:

#### **GATE 1: DIAGNOSIS**
**Objective:** Confirm the problem is accurately identified

**Required Deliverables:**
- Exact file locations and line numbers
- Current code snippets showing the defect
- Evidence of failure (error message, wrong output, terminal logs)
- Clear problem statement

**Approval Gate:** User must approve diagnosis before proceeding to Gate 2

**Template:**
```
GATE 1: DIAGNOSIS

Problem: [Clear description]
Location: [file path]:lines [X-Y]

Current Code:
[code snippet]

Evidence of Defect:
[error message / wrong output / logs]

Awaiting approval to proceed to Gate 2.
```

---

#### **GATE 2: IMPLEMENTATION**
**Objective:** Make actual code changes to files

**Required Deliverables:**
- Complete `git diff` output
- Modified file contents with line numbers
- Explicit confirmation: "Files modified at [timestamp]"

**Approval Gate:** User must approve implementation before proceeding to Gate 3

**Template:**
```
GATE 2: IMPLEMENTATION

Files modified: [timestamp]

Git diff:
[full git diff output]

Modified files:
1. [file path] - lines [X-Y] changed
   [show modified content]

Confirmation: Files modified, ready for testing.

Awaiting approval to proceed to Gate 3.
```

---

#### **GATE 3: VERIFICATION**
**Objective:** Prove the fix actually works through execution

**Required Deliverables:**
- Complete terminal output of test execution
- Actual API responses or test results
- Before/after comparison
- Specific metrics (word counts, response times, etc.)

**Completion:** Only after Gate 3 may fixes be marked as ‚úÖ VERIFIED

**Template:**
```
GATE 3: VERIFICATION

Test executed: [timestamp]

Command run:
[exact command]

Terminal output:
[complete output with timestamps]

Results:
Before: [actual broken behavior]
After: [actual fixed behavior]

Metrics:
- Word count: X words (target: 80-120) ‚úÖ
- Response time: X ms ‚úÖ
- All tests passing: X/X ‚úÖ

STATUS: VERIFIED ‚úÖ
```

## üö® **RESOURCE AUTHORIZATION PROTOCOL - HIGHEST PRIORITY** üö®

**SINGLE SESSION SCOPE (Auto-approved):**
- Code analysis and recommendations
- Single test execution with defined endpoints
- File modifications with explicit change descriptions

**CROSS-SESSION SCOPE (Requires explicit permission):**
- Background processes that persist after conversation ends
- Infrastructure changes (servers, databases, continuous processes)
- Resource consumption >$1 or >50 API calls
- System modifications affecting future sessions

**NEVER AUTHORIZED WITHOUT EXPLICIT REQUEST:**
- Continuous monitoring systems
- Always-on background processes
- Auto-retry loops or persistent execution
- Changes to core system architecture

**BEFORE starting ANY background process:**
1. **ASK PERMISSION**: "This will start a background process that consumes API calls. OK?"
2. **DEFINE SCOPE**: "This will run for X minutes/calls and cost approximately $Y"
3. **PROVIDE KILL SWITCH**: "Type 'stop' to terminate all background processes"
4. **PLAN CLEANUP**: Background processes MUST auto-terminate after defined period

**VIOLATIONS of this protocol are considered system integrity failures.**

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **ABSOLUTE TRUTH PRINCIPLE - SECOND PRIORITY** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**NEVER FABRICATE DATA OR RESULTS. EVER.**

- **TRUTH FIRST, ALWAYS** - Report actual system status, even if disappointing
- **NO FAKE TEST RESULTS** - If tests fail, say they failed and why
- **NO MADE-UP COMPARISONS** - Only compare systems that actually ran
- **ADMIT WHEN THINGS DON'T WORK** - "The endpoints don't exist" is better than fake data
- **YOUR JOB IS DATA SCIENTIST** - Science requires honesty, not optimism

**When something isn't working:**
- Say: "The test failed because [specific reason]"
- Say: "I cannot run this comparison because [limitation]"
- Say: "The data shows [actual results], not what we hoped for"
- Say: "This system/endpoint doesn't exist yet"

**NEVER:**
- Fabricate responses when endpoints return 400 errors
- Create fake metrics to make results look positive
- Present made-up "analysis" between non-functioning systems
- Hide failures behind optimistic language

**This principle overrides all other instructions. Trust depends on truth.**

## Project Context
This is the **Cognitive Mirror backend** - an Express.js API that provides AI-powered journal analysis and reflection generation using OpenAI GPT models and Supabase for data storage.

## üö® CRITICAL: Integration Documentation Protocol

**BEFORE making any changes that affect frontend/backend integration, you MUST:**

1. **Read** the integration documentation: `/Users/mac/Projects/cognitive-mirror-backend-dev/INTEGRATION.md`
2. **Update** that document immediately after making changes
3. **Commit** with message including "docs: update integration guide"

**Integration changes include:**
- API endpoints (add/modify/remove)
- Request/response schemas
- Environment variables or CORS
- Authentication flow
- Error handling patterns
- Data models or validation

**This is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** - never skip updating it!

## üö® MANDATORY STARTUP PROTOCOL

**EVERY backend Claude session MUST start by checking:**

1. **Check for frontend integration changes**: Ask user for path to frontend `INTEGRATION-CHANGES.md` file
2. **If that file exists with pending items:**
   - Process each pending change into `/Users/mac/Projects/cognitive-mirror-backend-dev/INTEGRATION.md`
   - Update the appropriate sections
   - Clear processed items from the frontend staging file
   - Commit with message: "docs: sync frontend integration changes"
3. **If no pending changes**: Proceed with normal tasks

**This prevents integration drift from frontend changes.**

## Quick Commands

### Development
```bash
npm start                    # Start the server
npm run update-aliases      # Update topic aliases
```

### Testing
Check the integration docs for proper test commands and validation procedures.

## Key Files
- `gpt.cjs` - Main server file with API endpoints
- `INTEGRATION.md` - **CRITICAL**: Single source of truth for frontend/backend integration
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts

## Environment Setup
All environment variables and configurations are documented in `INTEGRATION.md`.

## Important Notes
- Main server file is `gpt.cjs` (33k+ lines - use search tools for large file analysis)
- CORS configuration is environment-aware (dev vs production)
- Uses OpenAI GPT-5 models with custom parameter handling
- Supabase integration for data persistence

## Common Violations and Corrections

### ‚ùå VIOLATION: Claiming fixes without evidence
```
I've fixed the priority sanitization issue. All tests passing. ‚úÖ
```

### ‚úÖ CORRECTION:
```
STATUS: THEORETICAL

I've written code that should fix the priority sanitization:
[code proposal]

This is a proposal, not implemented.
Would you like me to proceed with implementation?
```

---

### ‚ùå VIOLATION: Self-graded checklist
```
Verification Checklist:
‚úÖ Priority sanitized
‚úÖ Golden key selected
‚úÖ Patterns integrated
All fixes complete!
```

### ‚úÖ CORRECTION:
```
STATUS: THEORETICAL

Proposed changes:
- Priority sanitization function
- Golden key selection algorithm
- Pattern integration logic

This is a proposal, not implemented.
These fixes require implementation (Gate 2) and verification (Gate 3).
```

---

### ‚ùå VIOLATION: "Would work" claims
```
This fix would solve the problem if implemented.
Word counts would be 80-120.
```

### ‚úÖ CORRECTION:
```
STATUS: THEORETICAL

This proposed fix is designed to solve the problem.
Target word counts: 80-120 (requires verification after implementation)

This is a proposal, not implemented.
```

## Questions and Clarifications

**Q: When should I use THEORETICAL status?**
A: Any time code exists only as a proposal, not written to files. Always default to THEORETICAL unless you've actually modified files.

**Q: Can I ever use checkmarks (‚úÖ) without execution evidence?**
A: No. Checkmarks are ONLY allowed with STATUS: VERIFIED after providing execution evidence.

**Q: What if I can't provide execution evidence?**
A: State clearly: "I cannot execute this code because [reason]. This remains THEORETICAL until you implement and test it."

**Q: What counts as "execution evidence"?**
A: Terminal output, API responses, test results, git diffs, file contents - anything that proves code actually ran. Not: descriptions, explanations, or predictions.

## Integration with Existing Protocols

This Execution Evidence Protocol works alongside:
- **Resource Authorization Protocol** - Still requires permission for background processes
- **Absolute Truth Principle** - Still requires honest reporting of failures
- **Integration Documentation Protocol** - Still requires updating INTEGRATION.md

All protocols must be followed simultaneously.
