# Development Backups

This folder contains important backup files created during development sessions.

## Chronology Debugging Session Backups
These files represent the **working baseline** before the chronology debugging session that fixed the auto-scroll detection issue:

- `App.js.WORKING_BACKUP` - Main app component before chronology changes
- `JournalTimeline.js.WORKING_BACKUP` - Timeline component before chronology changes  
- `ChatBubble.js.WORKING_BACKUP` - Chat bubble component before chronology changes

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** These files are essential for rollback if chronology issues reoccur.

## Pre-Redesign Milestones
These files preserve the original implementations before major UI redesigns:

- `SummaryViewer.js.BEFORE_THERAPY_REDESIGN` - Original summary viewer before premium modal redesign
- `MoodModal.js.BEFORE_REDESIGN` - Original mood tracker before analytics redesign

## Usage
These backups can be restored by copying them back to their original locations and removing the backup suffix if needed for debugging or rollback purposes.
