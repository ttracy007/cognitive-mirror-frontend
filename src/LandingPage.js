    <h1>ðŸªž Welcome to Cognitive Mirror (Beta)</h1>
    <p><strong>Cognitive Mirror</strong> is a journaling experiment designed for anyone who wants to understand themselves more clearlyâ€”and for therapists looking to track what happens between sessions.</p>
    <p><strong>Itâ€™s not a substitute for professional help.</strong> If you're in serious distress, please reach out to a licensed mental health provider. But if youâ€™re simply stuck, spiraling, or unsure whatâ€™s going on inside youâ€”this mirror might help you see it.</p>
    <p>You can write freely, or speak your thoughts aloud. Either way, the mirror listens.</p>
    <p>It currently offers two voices:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ðŸ”´ <strong>Frank Friend</strong> â€“ direct, compassionate, and unfiltered.</li>
      <li>ðŸŸ¢ <strong>Stoic Mentor</strong> â€“ grounded, steady, and clear-eyed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Try both. See what resonates. The more honest you are, the more the mirror reflects back what really matters.</p>
