  <h1 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">ðŸªž Welcome to <strong>Cognitive Mirror (Beta)</strong></h1>

  <p style="line-height: 1.6; font-size: 1rem;">
    <strong>Cognitive Mirror</strong> is a journaling experiment designed for anyone who wants to understand themselves more clearlyâ€”
    and for therapists looking to track what happens between sessions.
  </p>

  <p style="line-height: 1.6; font-size: 1rem;">
    Itâ€™s <strong>not a substitute for professional help</strong>. If you're in serious distress, please reach out to a licensed mental health provider.
    But if youâ€™re simply stuck, spiraling, or unsure whatâ€™s going on inside youâ€”this mirror might help you see it.
  </p>

  <p style="line-height: 1.6; font-size: 1rem;">
    You can write freely, or speak your thoughts aloud. Either way, the mirror listens.
  </p>

  <p style="line-height: 1.6; font-size: 1rem;">It currently offers two voices:</p>
  <ul style="line-height: 1.6; font-size: 1rem; margin-left: 1.25rem;">
    <li><strong>ðŸ”´ Frank Friend</strong> â€“ direct, compassionate, and unfiltered. Think: the loyal friend who doesnâ€™t let you lie to yourself.</li>
    <li><strong>ðŸŸ¢ Stoic Mentor</strong> â€“ grounded, steady, and clear-eyed. Less about comfort, more about clarity.</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="line-height: 1.6; font-size: 1rem;">
    Try both. See what resonates. The more honest you are, the more the mirror reflects back what really matters.
